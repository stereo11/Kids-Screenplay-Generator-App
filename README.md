# Kids-Screenplay-Generator-App
This project involves the development of a web application to generate screenplays for kids' stories using Large Language Models (LLMs). The app takes user inputs like genre, character details, and visual effects requirements to produce a screenplay with detailed scenes, character information, and shots.
