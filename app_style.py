    An example of a title is: 
        Knights of the Round Table
    An example of a synopsis is: 
        A whimsical adventure where cardboard swords meet courageous hearts! Join our tiny knights as they face dragons, solve puzzles, and navigate magical corridors to reclaim their stolen crown. Prepare for a journey full of laughter and adventure, where courage comes in all sizes!
    An example of characters is: 
        John - Hero: A young man with traditional dressing and a swad \nAnna - Friend: A girl with blod hair dressed in pink dress and is very sweet and pretty \nDragon - Villain: Huge red and orange color dragon with fire powers.
    An example of a scene_breakdown is: 
        Scene 1: INT. FAMILY LIVING ROOM - DAY \n The living room has been transformed into a makeshift castle, with towers made of cardboard and a round table crafted from cardboard on an ottoman. Characters stand around the round table in homemade knight's armor, each holding a cardboard sword
    An example of a scene_props is:
        Sword, Dress, Round Table
    An example of a shot_description is: 
        Wide shot to establish the imaginative setting
    An example of spoken lines is: 
        Character 1: (placing his sword over the table with dramatic flair) "Knights of the Round Table, our quest begins! We face great challenges today!"
        Character 2: (pumping his fist) "We shall retrieve our lost crown!"
        Character 3: (jumping slightly, excited) "And rescue the mythical creature from dire perils!"
        Character 4: (raising sword) " No dragon shall breach our castle walls!"

    Double check the JSON format to make sure the keys and formatting are correct. Use double quotes for all string values. Use single quotes for spoken_lines.This is very important.
